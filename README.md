<h2>Weather-App</h2>

I used Yahoo's Weather API to print the sunrise time in the city of Mumbai in console.

The API EndPoint is => https://weather-ydn-yql.media.yahoo.com/forecastrss?location=mumbai&format=json .

We can use this app for other cities of the world by changing the "location" parameter to be the city name where we want to know the sunrise time. 

Also, we can change the format of the data to be "xml" as per our requirement.

Example => (for Delhi City)  https://weather-ydn-yql.media.yahoo.com/forecastrss?location=Delhi&format=xml
